# CICS 191FY1, Jimmy Nguyen, SEC 16
At first, when I first heard about my seminar class about **Math Puzzle**, I immediately thought of *logic board games* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) or *old video games* like *Sudoku* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudoku). 
But after having the first lessons, I feel **Math Puzzle** is really good. It intrigues me because of the way logic is used to solve each problem. Logic problems embedded in stories like "train tracks", "Harry Potter's vases"...
***Logic is an essential thing in programming and coding. These problems will help me increase my ability to think logically, which will help me a lot in programming.***
