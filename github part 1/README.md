# CICS 191FY1, Jimmy Nguyen, SEC 16
At first, when I first heard about my seminar class about **Math Puzzle**, I immediately thought of *logic board games* or *old video games* like *Sudoku*. 
But after having the first lessons, I feel **Math Puzzle** is really good. It intrigues me because of the way logic is used to solve each problem. Logic problems embedded in stories like "train tracks", "Harry Potter's vases"...
***Logic is an essential thing in programming and coding. These problems will help me increase my ability to think logically, which will help me a lot in programming.*** There are some prompts about puzzles that I enjoyed:
* *Sudoku* (An old game about solving Math Puzzle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudoku)
* *Sherlock* (TV series base on *Sherlock Holmes novel*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series))
* *Squid game* (This is a South Korean survival drama TV series streaming on Netflix. It became one of Netflix's most watched programs in several regional markets within a week: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)
* *Chess* (A game/sport use many logic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
